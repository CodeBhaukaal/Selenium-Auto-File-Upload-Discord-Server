# About This Project
This Python script utilizes Selenium WebDriver to automate interactions with the Discord web application. Let's break down the code step by step:

Importing Libraries:

selenium: Used for web automation.
json: Used for reading and writing JSON files.
os: Used for interacting with the operating system, such as checking file paths.
Reading Configuration:

The script first checks if a config.json file exists in the current directory.
If the file exists, it reads the data from it. If not, it creates a default template with "Token" and "Prefix" keys and writes it to config.json.
Setting up WebDriver:

It initializes a Chrome WebDriver and maximizes the browser window.
It navigates to the Discord login page.
Logging into Discord:

It executes JavaScript to set the Discord token in the local storage, enabling automatic login.
After a delay, it navigates to the specified channel (uploadfile_channel).
Uploading Files:

It retrieves the folder path from the configuration.
It constructs a list of file paths by joining the folder path with each file in the folder.
For each image file, it finds the element for uploading files and sends the file path to it.
After a delay, it simulates pressing the ENTER key to upload the file.
This process is repeated for each file in the folder.
Waiting and Quitting:

After all files are uploaded, the script waits for 1800 seconds (30 minutes) before quitting the WebDriver instance.
Notes:

Make sure to have chromedriver installed and available in your PATH for using webdriver.Chrome().
Ensure the correctness of XPaths used for locating elements in the Discord web interface.
Adjust sleep times according to the responsiveness of the web application and network speed.
This script seems to be designed to automate the process of uploading files to a Discord channel, presumably for some specific purpose like sharing images or documents.
